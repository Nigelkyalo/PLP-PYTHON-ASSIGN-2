# Assignment 2 - Python List Operations

This project contains a single Python script, `Assign2.py`, which demonstrates basic list operations in Python.

## Features
- Creates an empty list
- Appends elements (10, 20, 30, 40)
- Inserts an element (15) at a specific position
- Extends the list with multiple elements ([50, 60, 70])
- Removes the last element
- Sorts the list in ascending order
- Finds and prints the index of a specific value (30)
- Prints the final list and the index of 30

## Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
2. Run the script using the command:
   
   ```powershell
   python Assign2.py
   ```
3. The output will display the final state of the list and the index of the value 30.

## Example Output
```
List: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
Index of 30: 3
```
